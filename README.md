OVERVIEW
For this assignment, I created an online Justin Beiber shopping website using MySQL and Node.js.  I made 3 consoles views: customer view, manager view, and supervisor view.  

CUSTOMER VIEW
Command line command to run app with customer view
"node biebayCustomer.js" 
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/CustomerProductTable.png)
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/CustomerProductTable2.png)

This is the table of the current products for sale from the database.
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/CustomerCompletedSale.png)
After the transaction is completed, the inventory is updated and the product sales are updated in deparments tables.

 MANAGER VIEW
 Command line command to run app with customer view
"node biebayManager.js"
This is the opening view for the manager
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/ManagerOpening.png)
The current products for sale looks the same as the customer view
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/lowinventory.png)
View to view low inventory and reorder
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/inventoryadd.png)
View to add inventory
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/addnewitem.png)
View to add new item


SUPERVISOR VIEW
Command line command to run app with customer view
"node biebaySupervisor.js"
This is the view for sales by department
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/SupervisorDeprtments.png)
This is the view for adding a department
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/AddDepartment.png)
