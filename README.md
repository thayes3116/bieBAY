OVERVIEW
For this assignment, I created an online Justin Beiber shopping website using MySQL and Node.js.  I made 3 consoles views: customer view, manager view, and supervisor view.  

CUSTOMER VIEW
Command line command to run app with customer view
"node biebayCustomer.js" (without quotations)
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/CustomerProductTable.png)
![](/Images_for_Read_Me/CustomerProductTable2.png)

This is the table of the current products for sale from the database.

After the transaction is completed, the inventory is updated and the product sales are updated in deparments tables.
